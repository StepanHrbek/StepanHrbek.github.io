<h3>What's that?</h3>

Idea behind RAIN is to provide high-quality high-level audio services
(like playing xm, mp3..)
to wide range of applications,
especially in cases where all other techniques fail:

<font size="-1">
<ul>
 <li>DOS programs run under Windows 
     (thay fail because Windows tend to hide soundcard ports; and ports could be
     quite non-standard anyway and useful only via Windows driver)
 <li>16bit DOS real or protected mode programs 
     (programmers fail because there are no good 16bit audio libraries)
</ul>
</font>

RAIN is framework for your DOS and Windows applications. 
There are precompiled audio servers and nice high-level C/C++ and Pascal API 
to access them from your clients.
<p>
With RAIN it is easy to write Windows applications 
and 16 or 32bit real or protected mode DOS applications fully working in 
both DOS and Windows (9x/Me/NT/2k/XP).
