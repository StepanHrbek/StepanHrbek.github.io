<h3>Configuring servers</h3>

Default server behaviour is to autodetect everything.
<p>
But user may also run config (rain -c)
and let server write its config file midas.dos or midas.win.
In this case, server first tries to overwrite existing config file
in default directory and then in directory with running rain.exe.
If there's no config file yet, server tries to create it in default directory
and then (if not successful) in directory with running rain.exe.
At server startup, config file is searched first in default directory
and then in directory with running rain.exe.
<p>
There are default values that may be confgured (high quality mixing,
100ms long buffer) but also hardwired values like
3sec mp3 buffer,
minimum of 40 polls per sec to play mp3 without interrupts,
32 channels for modules and 8 for samples,
in DOS server 2MB for modules, samples and stream buffers...
In case of need I can change these values or make them configurable by user or client.
