  Incorporating global illumination is important step towards realism 
  in computer graphics.
  There are many areas where graphics realism is high priority.
  Yet global illumination is still not as widespread in renderers around us
  as we could expect.
  <p>
  Closer look reveals possible cause,
  there remain serious usability problems related to typical global illumination
  software, mainly:<ul>
  <li>noninteractive nature (set parameters, wait considerable amount of 
    time, see the result)
  <li>need to set up many parameters (light and material properties).
    Global illumination solver inputs are typically incompatible with data available
    to local illumination renderer, so user is required to enter missing data.
    Even when automatic conversion of data is possible, it must be updated each time
    local illumination model changes.
  </ul>
  <p>
  Problem of full interactivity has been studied with interesting results from Keller
  [1], he offers fully dynamic and realtime solution, rendering is slower, speed depends 
    on requested quality.
    Keller's results from 1997 are hard to compare with todays renderers, so we 
    reimplemented it on nVidia GeForce 6600: 30000 triangle scene with 1000
    light samples was rendered at 3fps, including generation of 1000 shadowmaps.
    Speed may be increased by caching intermediate results.
  New approach with very high quality realtime outputs is presented by Kristensen et al
  [2], but it is suitable only for relighting of static geometry, expensive precomputations 
    are required.
  <p>
  Problem of incompatibilities between global illumination solver
  and arbitrary local illumination renderer and ways to smooth integration
  probably haven't been studied.
  <p>
  We present novel approach to integration of global illumination solver
  into arbitrary realtime local illumination rendering systems.
  Our approach makes no assumptions about local illumination model
  and extends it to global illumination while not slowing it down.
  So when applied to arbitrary realtime local illumination renderer,
  it contributes also to domain of interactive radiosity.
  <p>
  Our process uses local illumination renderer to output specific images,
  those are analyzed and complete input information for global illumination
  renderer is automatically extracted.
  <p>
  An example is presented in form of realtime radiosity viewer.

  3 steps are necessary to fully integrate global illumination solver into
  arbitrary local illumination renderer.
  <p>

  <b>First</b>, material properties of scene surfaces must be acquired.
  This is handled by rendering all scene surfaces into several texture(s):
  <ol>
  <li>Emission: Clear texture to black and render faces without any lights in scene.
  <li>Transmission: Clear texture to white and render faces without any lights in scene.
  <li>Reflection: Clear texture to black and render faces with one light of unit intensity. Subtract emission.
  </ol>
  Now we have basic material properties for every pixel in scene, with 
  precision controlled by our texture resolution.
  In fact, we found sufficient to detect material properties only
  per local illumination renderer material, but this depends on uniformity of
  materials defined by local illumination renderer.
  <p>
  This way we detect basic properties, which is often enough for adequate global
  illumination. It is possible and option for future experiments to acquire
  complete BRDF function for every pixel in scene. This could be done by
  repeatedly placing light and camera to different positions
  relative to face being rendered.
  <p>
  Although acquiring BRDF would take seconds to minutes for medium size scene,
  material properties detected 
  in this step don't change during light or object manipulation in scene, so
  eventual slowness of detection doesn't affect later realtime rendering and 
  relighting during scene manipulation.
  <p>

  <b>Second</b>, local illumination present in scene must be acquired.
  This is done by clearing texture to black and rendering scene surfaces into it
  using all local lights present in scene. RGB colors in texture
  correspond to material's response to local illumination + material's
  own emittance.
  For conversion between RGB colors and radiometry units,
  we use standard 0.45 power approximation.
  <p>
  Rendering all faces into texture without affecting local illumination
  may require changes in renderer. We use optional position overwrite
  at the end of affected vertex shaders. Whole vertex shader, possibly including
  lighting/shadowing computations, works with its usual 3D positions 
  as if rendering to screen, our face position in texture is loaded 
  before shader end from additional vertex stream.
  <p>
  For realistic response to primary illumination, it is important 
  to render into float texture, so oversaturated regions 
  are processed without clamping to max displayable color.
  <p>
  This step is repeated after each light or object manipulation in scene,
  so it should be as fast as possible.
  <p>
  We found that 3D scenes typically contain only small number of large faces,
  so after adding small number of vertices and splitting large faces, 
  we may detect local illumination per face instead of per pixel,
  without visible loss of quality.

  <p>
  <b>Third</b>, illumination calculated by global illumination solver 
  (using material properties and local illumination detected in first two steps) 
  is added to local illumination renderer as ambient term. 
  In case of our example viewer, it is added per vertex.
  <p>
  Scene Sponza atrium is example of not adjusted scene with large faces
  on the floor. Local illumination in our example viewer is detected per face
  and indirect illumination rendered per face,
  which causes visible errors in illumination.

  Our building stones were:
  <ul>
  <li>
    Local illumination renderer with soft shadows from [3]. We modified it to support
    any OpenGL 2.0 compliant graphics card and to load .3ds files with diffuse surfaces.
    Local illumination model can be arbitrarily changed via GLSL shaders.
  <li>
    Radiosity calculator with progressive refinement from [4].
    We improved it using new acceleration structure (to be published later)
    and made available as library [5].
  </ul>
  Complete integration of our radiosity calculator library into renderer took less than 
  two days.
  For comparison, the same integration process with very complex and feature-rich
  realtime renderer for next generation games took approx. two weeks.
  <p>
  Viewer may freely manipulate camera and light positions in scene.
  Global illumination quality is temporarily decreased after each light manipulation.
  Currently there is no possibility to manipulate scene, but it may be added in
  future version, since it would make only small performance loss.
  <p>
  Light in viewer has no distance attenuation, but anyone can add
  it by modifying GLSL shaders. Changes of local illumination model are 
  completely transparent and don't require recompilation.
  <p>
  OpenGL 2.0 capable graphics card is required, tested on NVIDIA GeForce 6600, ATI Radeon X800.
  May work with other .3ds scenes, but it wasn't tested.

  We have presented novel approach to integration of global illumination calculator
  into arbitrary local illumination renderer without common usability problems.
  In our sample, which is provided, global illumination was transparently added into 
  realtime renderer with diffuse surfaces and soft shadows in less than two days.
  Global illumination is correctly calculated without need to recompile even when 
  local illumination model is arbitrarily changed via GLSL shaders.
  Key factor is that all input data for global illumination calculator are extracted
  from images generated by local illumination renderer.
